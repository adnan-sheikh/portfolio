                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                </div>
                <p>Hi! My name is Adnan Sheikh. I am a Mumbai based, Mechanical Engineering graduate. My passion in programming was from my college days when I was in 3rd year. We were having a subject called Theory of Machines and under the subject there was a practical to develop a program in C language, which accepts various inputs and outputs the value based on Gyroscopic formula.
                    <br>
                    While I was in my final year of graduation, I joined a local institute to learn CAD, FEA and CFD softwares to design and analyse machines on computer. After my graduation, the sister company of the institute hired me for a full-time role. My responsibility was to design 3D models of machines and structures and analysing them by simulation in CAE softwares.
                    <br>
                    After 2 and a half years working there still with some hope to work in a software industry, lockdown happened and it gave me a chance to study Software Engineering. Being home, I took CS with Python course on Codecademy, which immensely increased my interest and so then I took Front End Engineer Career Path. And now I am here developing Web applications.

                    <h2>Number Guesser Game</h2>
                    <p>This project was part of Codecademy projects. There's a target number which is generated randomly. So user inputs a value in between 0 and 10, and computer also guesses a random value. Whoever's guess is closest to target value wins.</p>
