            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>HI! My name is Adnan Sheikh. I am a Mumbai based, Mechanical Engineering graduate. My passion in programming was from my college days when I was in 3rd year. We were having a subject called Theory of Machines and under the subject there was a practical to develop a program in C language, which accepts various inputs and outputs the value based on Gyroscopic formula.
                <br>
                While I was in my final year of graduation, I joined a local institute to learn CAD, FEA and CFD softwares to design and analyse machines on computer. After my graduation, the sister company of the institute hired me for a full-time role. My responsibility was to design 3D models of machines and structures and analysing them by simulation in CAE softwares.
                <br>
                After 2 and a half years working there still with some hope to work in a software industry, lockdown happened and it gave me a chance to study Software Engineering. Being home, I took CS with Python course on Codecademy, which immensely increased my interest and so then I took Front End Engineer Career Path. And now I am here developing Web applications.
