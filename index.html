          </div>
          <p>
            Hi! My name is Adnan Sheikh. I am a Mumbai based, Mechanical
            Engineering graduate. My passion in programming was from my college
            days when I was in 3rd year. We were having a subject called Theory
            of Machines and under the subject there was a practical to develop a
            program in C language, which accepts various inputs and outputs the
            value based on Gyroscopic formula.

          <div class="full-about">
            <p>
              <br />
              While I was in my final year of graduation, I joined a local
              institute to learn CAD, FEA and CFD softwares to design and
              analyse machines on computer. After my graduation, the sister
              company of the institute hired me for a full-time role. My
              responsibility was to design 3D models of machines and structures
              and analysing them by simulation in CAE softwares.
              <br />
              <br />
              After 2 and a half years working there still with some hope to
              work in a software industry, lockdown happened and it gave me a
              chance to study Software Engineering. Being home, I took CS with
              Python course on Codecademy, which immensely increased my interest
              and so then I took Front End Engineer Career Path. And now I am
              here developing Web applications.
