# Portfolio project

This project is a part of Codecademy Front End Engineer Career Path.

My portfolio website highlights the projects I have completed so far in my journey.

Even this portfolio project uses the skills that I have acquired uptill now, HTML5, CSS3, Grid and Flexbox, Transitions and Animations, Javascript and DOM Manipulation to add interactivity.
